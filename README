NAME
    PDT - Perl Development and Testing network.

*EARLY STAGE WARNING*
    This module is currently in the early stages. For the latest please
    check the github page at <http://github.com/exodist/PDT>

DESCRIPTION
    PDT stands for Perl Development and Testing. It is a centralized P2P
    testing framework for perl. Ever have a hard time testing your module on
    a platform to which you don't have access? Ever have to wait a couple
    days to see if your locally passing tests are failing in cpan testers?
    Than this application is for you.

    This application handles perl testing in a non-passive way. Instead of
    waiting and hoping someone will test your module on an obscure platform,
    you can push your module to be tested on that platform immedietly.
